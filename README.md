# Borg

This is an exploration of Python class construction using the Borg 
pattern (and stretching the Borg analogy in ways it wasn't meant to be 
stretched).

Each exploration contains a short demo that can be run as the module's
*'\__main\__'*. This project contains the following sets of code:

## Highlander

This is the typical Borg implementation where there really can only be
one item, and every instance of the item just points back to the
original instance.

Ignore the fact that in the demo the Borg seem more like Highlanders.

## Borg Factions

The Borg have had a schism, and they now only share the same hive mind
if they have the same faction.

## Borg Workers

The Borg have decided that they want to save on wifi costs back to the
mothership, so they want the ability to create specialized workers in 
the field that will sync back with each other, and not dump their all
their data back to the hive mind.

## Borg Children

The borg have decided to have progeny, but unlike most parents, they
want their children to have minds of their own (while still sharing a
collective mind with others in their birth group, of course).
